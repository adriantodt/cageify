# Cagify

Cagify is a simple jQuery plugin for making any website MOAR awesome!

## Installation

#### Install with Bower

Pull this code in with bower by running the following in your shell:

```
bower install cagify
```


1. Include jQuery any way you want (I recommend the Google CDN or putting it in your build process).
2. Pull in `js/cagify.js` from wherever you got this (hopefully Bower) in your build or as a script tag.

## Use

To use Cagify, just call `.cagify()` on any jquery selector!

MAKE YOUR PAGE AWESOME!

```js
$('body').cagify();
```

## Too Much Cage?

We don't think so!

But if you want, you can just cagify a part of your page.

```js
$('.not-as-cool').cagify();
```
